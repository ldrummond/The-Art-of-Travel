		Overlooking the motorway between London and Manchester, in a flat, featureless expanse of country, stands a single-story glass-and-redbrick service <a href="station4.html"> station </a>. In its forecourt hangs a giant laminated flag that advertises to motorists and to sheep in an adjacent field a photograph of a fried egg, two sausages and a peninsula of baked beans.
